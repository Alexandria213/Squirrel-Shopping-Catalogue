# A list-like photo album

A Flutter practice project.

## Photo Album

This app was built as part of a computer science class for anyone to use,off of a to-do list framework and modified to house images that you come across that you might want to use later. 

By copy and pasting the image link into a test box and writing a short description, you can see the image link, small preview of the image, 
and the image description that you wrote.
